    <p>A brief history</p>

    <p>
      Carly and I met over D&D on a saturday night surrounded by friends. We
      ended up playing tabletop games<br />
      with those same friends for over two years. We quickly became friends
      during this time and often discussed nerdy topics like Harry Potter.<br />
      She is a total nerd when it comes to medicine and biology, reading up on
      any interesting article she finds.

          Although we have known each other for years, Carly and I have been
          engaged for a little over five months now.

          While I am working on becoming a web developer, she is focused on
          becoming a registered nurse.
